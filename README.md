You can find a working example of the [KetoDiet Body Fat Calculator](http://ketodietapp.com/Blog/page/body-fat-calculator) on the [KetoDiet Blog](http://ketodietapp.com/Blog).

### Getting Started

You'll have to setup a simple React & Docker dev environment. Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
1. Clone or Download Github repository
1. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the project directory
1. Execute `docker-compose up`. This will launch the docker container and fetch all the dependencies. It may take some a few minutes to execute the first time you run it
1. Open a web browser and type the URL http://localhost:8080 to open the demo page

### Develop & Debug

1. We use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) & Chrome for development. You can download  trial version of WebStorm to try it.
1. The demo page is developed using ReactJS. To find out more about ReactJS, please visit [https://facebook.github.io/react/](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
